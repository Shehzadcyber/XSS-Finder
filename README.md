# XSS-Finder
The XSS-Finder,  I created for my bug bounty hunting process. It helps me quickly find Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by trying different inputs with a variety of XSS attack codes. It has a simple command-line interface that makes it easy to use, allowing me to test web applications for XSS vulnerabilities efficiently and automatically.
